`Meshy-UI` is a template designed for speedy application development with an emphasis in astronomy.  It uses a collection of third party
open-source libraries and incorporates them into a framework that focuses on application logic instead of the
necessary but boilerplate-like aspect of JavaScript web development. By combining libraries that is best suited for web-based astronomy
application development, <em>Meshy-UI</em> allows developer to concentrate on requirements instead of learning the technology needed to fulfill
those requirements.





## Getting Started

`Meshy-UI` is a github template.  You can either create a fork of the repository or create your own repository from this template.  
Or, if you only wish to experiment with `Meshy-UI`, you can clone `Meshy-UI` directly without creating your own repository.

    git clone https://github.com/loitly/meshy-ui

`Meshy-UI` comes with examples.  To create the examples application, run

    cd meshy-ui
    yarn examples
    yarn dev

The above commands build and deploy the examples application running on your local machine with hot reloading.  This means it will monitor source
files for changes and will automatically build and update the deployment with those changes.  
Goto [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in your default browser.

To remove the examples application, run

    yarn examples clean
