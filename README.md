`Meshy-UI` is a template designed for speedy application development with an emphasis in astronomy.  It uses a collection of third party
open-source libraries and incorporates them into a framework that focuses on application logic instead of the
necessary but boilerplate-like aspect of JavaScript web development. By combining libraries that is best suited for web-based astronomy
application development, <em>Meshy-UI</em> allows developer to concentrate on requirements instead of learning the technology needed to fulfill
those requirements.
